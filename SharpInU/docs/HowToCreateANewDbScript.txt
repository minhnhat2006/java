How to create a new database script
==============================================================
	1. Choose the correct phase folder to put your script. If it doesn't have suitable folder, please create a new one.
		i.e I am working on Phase 2 of project. If I need change something with database, I will put my script in to folder "/database/phase2"
	2. Put your script into the folder above and naming your file with number prefix. The prefix will start with number 1. Please don't use any existing prefix.
		i.e I need add a email table for this phase. I will put my script into the file "1_DB_CHANGES.sql".
	3. Edit database information in LoadScripts.bat and run it to make changes into your database.
	4. The correctly script can be run multiple times by LoadScripts.bat without any errors. If you find any error in console, please check and correct it before you commit it.
